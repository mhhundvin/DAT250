###The installation 
Even tho I didn't have any of the required software installed, except Git, I did not encounter any major problems. The only problem I had was the installation of Maven, because I was a bit unsure about which version to get. I solved this by googling, where I found a tutorial to follow.

###Validating the software
After the installations I checked that the software was working by running the different versions commands. Like mvn -v for maven, heroku login for heroku and java -version for the jdk.
